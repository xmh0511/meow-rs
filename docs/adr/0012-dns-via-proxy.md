# ADR 0012: Route DNS clients through a proxy adapter (`#PROXY` nameserver suffix)

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-05-19
- **Author:** Claude (on behalf of @madeye)
- **Related:** issue #67, PR #88 (per-proxy DNS for `type: direct`)

## Context

Issue #67 has two parts:

1. **"When the rule engine matches a request to a proxy, route the DNS lookup through that proxy."**
2. **"Allow configuring a dedicated DNS server for a specific proxy or proxy group."**

Part 2 is largely covered today:

- For non-direct outbounds (SS / Trojan / VLESS / HTTP), the **hostname is forwarded to the remote** (`shadowsocks_adapter.rs:295`, `http_adapter.rs:117`, etc.). The remote server performs the DNS lookup, so per-proxy DNS is effectively the remote's resolver.
- For direct outbounds, PR #88 added a `dns:` field on `type: direct` proxies. The `DirectAdapter` resolves hostnames against the configured servers via an injected `Resolver`.
- `nameserver-policy` already supports per-domain routing of DNS queries to specific upstreams.

What is **not** covered is the deeper "DNS query routed *through* a proxy adapter" pattern. Upstream Clash / mihomo support a `1.1.1.1#PROXY-NAME` syntax on `nameserver:` entries, where the DNS exchange itself is tunneled through the named proxy's TCP/UDP relay. This lets a user say "ask Google DNS, but go through my Japan exit," which is the classic case for resolving geo-fenced records correctly.

This ADR proposes the syntax, the loop-prevention rules, and the layering for implementing that feature on top of the current `DnsClient` / `Resolver` design.

## Decision

### Syntax

Extend `NameServerUrl` (`crates/mihomo-dns/src/upstream.rs`) so each variant carries an optional `proxy: Option<String>`:

```rust
NameServerUrl::Udp { addr, port, proxy: Option<String> }
NameServerUrl::Tcp { addr, port, proxy: Option<String> }
NameServerUrl::Tls { addr, port, sni, proxy: Option<String> }
NameServerUrl::Https { addr, port, path, sni, proxy: Option<String> }
```

Surface syntax:

| YAML string | Effect |
|---|---|
| `1.1.1.1` / `1.1.1.1:53` | Plain UDP, global resolver (unchanged) |
| `1.1.1.1#PROXY-JP` | Plain UDP, **but tunneled over PROXY-JP** |
| `tcp://1.1.1.1:53#PROXY-JP` | TCP DNS over PROXY-JP |
| `tls://1.1.1.1#dns.google` | DoT, current SNI fragment semantics (no proxy) |
| `tls://1.1.1.1#dns.google?proxy=PROXY-JP` | DoT over PROXY-JP (new — query-string disambiguator for TLS/HTTPS) |
| `https://1.1.1.1/dns-query#cloudflare-dns.com?proxy=PROXY-JP` | DoH over PROXY-JP |

The collision with SNI on `tls://` / `https://` URLs (which already use `#` for SNI) is resolved with a **query-string parameter** `?proxy=NAME` rather than a second fragment. This keeps the existing SNI semantics intact and avoids ambiguity.

For plain UDP/TCP nameservers (no SNI), the `#PROXY-NAME` suffix reuses the existing fragment slot, matching upstream Clash syntax.

### Loop prevention

DNS-over-proxy creates one hard loop hazard:

> Proxy `A` is configured with `dns: 1.1.1.1#PROXY-A`. To dial proxy A, the system needs to resolve A's server hostname `ss.example.com`. If that lookup is routed through PROXY-A, we re-enter `A.dial_tcp()` before A is dialable → infinite recursion.

**Mitigation rules** (enforced at config-parse time, hard error per ADR-0002 Class A — silent breakage in DNS is a privacy failure):

1. **Proxy-server hostnames must never resolve through a `#PROXY` client.** When the resolver dials a proxy adapter, it must use a *bootstrap* resolver that has no `#PROXY` entries. This is the same bootstrap path that already resolves `dns.google` for an encrypted upstream today (`resolver.rs:354–382`).
2. **Direct cycle detection**: if proxy `A` declares `dns: <anything>#A`, reject the config at load.
3. **Indirect cycles** (A→B→A) are detected by walking the proxy `dns:` graph at config load. A cycle is a Class A error.

### Architecture

```
Tunnel → match_rules → Proxy A → A.dial_tcp(metadata)        (data path)
                                  ^
                                  └── DnsClient(proxy=A).exchange()
                                          ^
                                          └── used by Resolver when YAML has `#A`
```

The `SocketFactory` indirection in `client.rs:34` returns concrete `TcpStream` / `UdpSocket`. We **do not** generalize the factory; instead `DnsClient` holds an optional `Arc<dyn Proxy>` and branches inside each exchange function:

```rust
async fn tcp_exchange(addr: SocketAddr, wire: &[u8], proxy: Option<&Arc<dyn Proxy>>) -> ... {
    let mut stream: Box<dyn AsyncRead + AsyncWrite + Unpin + Send> = match proxy {
        Some(p) => Box::new(p.dial_tcp(&dns_metadata(addr)).await?),
        None => Box::new(factory().connect_tcp(addr).await?),
    };
    write_lp(&mut stream, wire).await?;
    read_lp(&mut stream).await
}
```

For UDP-via-proxy, fall through to TCP DNS automatically (most proxies don't relay arbitrary UDP). Document this in the config docs — users wanting true UDP-over-proxy must set `udp: true` on the proxy AND use `tcp://` URL form (the TCP fallback is the safer default).

For DoT/DoH, layer `tokio_rustls` / HTTP/1.1 over the `Box<dyn AsyncRead+AsyncWrite>` exactly as today — the existing TLS connector is generic over `IO: AsyncRead + AsyncWrite + Unpin`.

### Proxy registry threading

`Resolver` construction (`new_with_bootstrap`) accepts a new `proxy_registry: Arc<HashMap<String, Arc<dyn Proxy>>>` parameter. The resolver resolves `#PROXY-NAME` strings to `Arc<dyn Proxy>` at construction time, failing fast (Class A) if the name is unknown — silent fallback to the global resolver would leak the query.

In `mihomo-config::build_config`, proxies are constructed before the resolver, so the registry handoff is straightforward.

### What this ADR does NOT cover

- **UDP-native DNS through proxy** when the proxy supports UDP. V1 routes all `#PROXY` queries over TCP. UDP-over-proxy is an optimization that can land later behind a `udp-dns: true` flag.
- **`fakeip` routing through proxy** — fake-IP synthesis happens *before* the proxy is chosen, so the question is meaningless for fakeip mode.
- **Per-rule-set DNS routing** (resolve domains in ruleset X via proxy Y). That's `nameserver-policy` territory and is already partially supported.

## Consequences

- One new field per `NameServerUrl` variant, one new `Resolver` constructor parameter, one new optional field on `DnsClient`. The default code path (no `#PROXY`) is unchanged.
- Two new Class A hard-errors at config load (unknown `#PROXY` name, cycle in `dns:` graph). Both are documented in the config reference.
- Bootstrap DNS (used to resolve proxy server hostnames) is explicitly a `#PROXY`-free resolver, breaking the loop.
- Tests need a mock `Proxy` that records the DNS message it was asked to relay; this is straightforward (`crates/mihomo-dns/tests/proxy_routed_dns_test.rs`).

## Implementation order

1. Extend `NameServerUrl` enum + parser. Behind a temporary `dns-via-proxy` feature flag.
2. Add `with_proxy` builder on `DnsClient`. Refactor exchange functions to take an optional proxy.
3. Thread proxy registry into `Resolver::new_with_bootstrap`.
4. Wire config-load: build proxies first, then resolver, then validate `#PROXY` references.
5. Cycle detection on the `dns:` graph.
6. Integration test with a stub `Proxy` adapter.
7. Remove feature flag; update config reference docs.
