//! RAII route installation for the TUN inbound's `auto-route`.
//!
//! v1 deliberately routes only the fake-IP range into the device (see the
//! module docs in `mod.rs` for the loop-freedom argument). Routes are added
//! with the blocking `route_manager` API at listener startup and removed on
//! drop; a failed add is a warning, not a fatal error, because the device
//! subnet's own on-link route frequently already covers the range (in which
//! case some platforms report "route exists").
